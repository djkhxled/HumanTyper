# 🖋️ Humantyper

**Humantyper** is a macOS app that simulates realistic human typing.  
It types text into any application with natural randomness, pauses, and speed variation — so it looks and feels like a real person is typing.

- **Jitter control** (random human variation in keystroke timing)  
- Optional **pauses on spaces, punctuation, and paragraphs** with customizable ranges
