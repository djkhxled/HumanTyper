# 🖋️ Humantyper

**Humantyper** is a macOS app that simulates realistic human typing.  
It types text into any application with natural randomness, pauses, and speed variation — so it looks and feels like a real person is typing.

## ✨ Features

- **Jitter control** (random human variation in keystroke timing)  
- Optional **pauses on spaces, punctuation, and paragraphs** with customizable ranges  
- 5-second **countdown timer** before typing begins, so you can switch to the target app/document
